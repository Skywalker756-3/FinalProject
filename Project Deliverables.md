### User Flow
We see it as a common case that return users want to see their horoscope so a basic version is displayed with priority at the top of the homepage. From there we have a navigation bar that leads to various other links where users can interact with the website further. And further down the page we contextualize and link to the other parts of the website that will be described below.

User's that are interested in a more in depth horoscope can discover more about the foretellings of different zodiac signs on the horoscope page.

User's that are interested in new insights and discoveries in Astrology can sign up for a newsletter on the newsletter page.

User's that are interested in knowing their best matchup's in relationships can find it on the game page. On this page user's can also play an interactive game to test their knowledge of the zodiac symbols.

User's can learn what other people are saying on the blog page.

User's can also login or sign-up on the login page. This allows for connecting the front-end design with backend technology to store user data. But for the scope of the project this functionality is strictly front-end.
