# User Experience Test & Evalutation

## Test 1
This was a test during a protype iteration of the website, we had a theme of purple and yellow with small amounts of yellow. The user was confused about what was and wasn't a button because the design was too intricate. To accomidate we removed alot of distracting parts of the website.

## Test 2
This test was focused on the game and the user's direct behaviour in it. We learned that it wasn't clear that the player had won the matching game and the user couldn't reset the game without reloading the page. We made adjustments thaty added these features.

## Test 3
This test restructured our website, we learned that the user actually scrolled past some of our content to get to where he wanted to go, which might have been a sign that we have a prioritization problem and a testing problem since in the previous tests users did not navigate as they would outside of a test because they were not scanning like an expected user.

## Test 4
We restructured our test to have a more disassociated version where instead of informing the user that this was a test we instead opted to find their compatibility with this site. It proved successful, the user navigated to the game page and ran the compatibility game quickly.

## Test 5
This final test was also prompted. We got the user who saw the prototype to discuss the homepage, it seemed like she liked it so we ended up keeping the design since we learned that it's ideal for navigation and style purposes.
